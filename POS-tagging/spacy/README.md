# POS Tagging with SpacCy

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using spaCy, a powerful and fast NLP library for Python. POS tagging is the process of assigning each word in a sentence a label that indicates its grammatical role, such as noun, verb, or adjective.

## What is spaCy
**spaCy** is an open-source, industrial-strength NLP library designed for fast and efficient processing of large volumes of text. It comes with pre-trained models for many languages and supports tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more.
